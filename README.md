# 💬 Secure Messaging Web Application

A full-stack messaging platform where users can securely sign up, log in, view their inbox, and exchange direct messages with others. Built using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **EJS**, this app showcases secure session-based communication, user authentication, CRUD operations, profile management, and basic one-on-one messaging functionality — all wrapped in a clean Bootstrap interfaces.


## ✨ Overview

> This project was developed as part of a full-stack assignment with a strong emphasis on secure authentication, real-time user interaction via form-based messaging, session handling, and dynamic views using server-side rendering.

It follows a clean MVC-style structure with the use of middleware, flash alerts, and database persistence using **Mongoose ODM** for MongoDB.


## 🚀 Core Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Session Management
- Register/login using email and password
- Passwords are securely hashed via `bcryptjs`
- Persistent sessions managed using `express-session` with MongoDB storage

### 📬 One-to-One Messaging System
- Authenticated users can view an inbox, select a recipient, and exchange messages
- Chat history is stored and sorted chronologically
- Messages are stored in a separate Mongoose model with sender/receiver references

### 🧑 User Profile
- Authenticated users can view and update their personal profile (bio, display name)
- Profile page shows current user data with live updates

### 📨 Flash Messaging
- Success/error messages are displayed using `connect-flash` for better UX
- Alerts shown on registration, login, logout, and profile updates

### 🛡️ Protected Routes
- Middleware `ensureAuth` restricts access to messaging, profile, and dashboard pages unless logged in

## 🔧 How It Works

### ✅ Authentication Flow
- New users register via `/register`
- On login (`/login`), Passport.js verifies credentials
- `express-session` stores session ID in cookie
- Middleware protects all routes requiring auth

### 💌 Messaging Logic
- Each message has a `sender`, `receiver`, `content`, and `createdAt`
- Messages are retrieved by filtering messages where `req.user` is either sender or receiver
- `/messages/inbox` shows messages received
- `/messages/chat/:id` opens a private conversation thread

### 👤 Profile Update
- Users can update their `bio` via `/profile`
- Bio is stored in the `User` model
- Flash message confirms update with “Profile updated!”



🧠 What You’ll Learn (Talking Points)
When presenting this to your instructor or interviewer, here’s what you can emphasize:

How Passport.js helps in secure login workflows

How middleware protects routes and ensures session persistence

How MongoDB is structured for 1-to-1 messaging (sender/receiver with object refs)

How EJS templates dynamically render content based on user and route data

The balance of security, simplicity, and user experience in a form-based app
